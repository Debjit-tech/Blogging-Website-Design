                            Kotlin is a statically typed language developed by JetBrains. Similar to Java, Kotlin has become a top choice for developing Android applications. This is evident from the fact that Android Studio comes with inbuilt support for Kotlin like it has for Java.
                            So, the question is whether one should switch to Kotlin from Java or not? Well, it depends on preferences. However, before making the switch it’s important to understand the distinction between the two programming languages.
                            One major difference between Java and Kotlin is that the latter has no provision for checked exceptions. Therefore, there is no need to catch or declare any exceptions.
                            If a developer working in Java finds it infuriating to use try/catch blocks in the code then the omission made by Kotlin can be considered a welcome change. However, it’s the opposite if the developer believes that checked exceptions encourage error recovery and the creation of robust code.

                            Web development, the terminology has a wide scope. From a simple write-up to a complex web page or complicated website of a business company, everything on the web is developed independently. Wikipedia, definitions, online websites, business application, and social networking applications are all individual sections of web development. The data collected and the database of every company or organization is developed by front-end developers and back-end developers.
                            Who are Front-End Developers?
                            Front-end developer is the designer, executor, and creator of the web pages we see on the computer screens. It is direct interaction with clients through sourcing data, information, images, and content on the page displayed to us on the computer system. Right from data developing to formatting it followed up by the display of web page, front-end developer is the direct face on the web. The designated person is responsible for the direct client interaction or view of the page. </div>

                            The advent of the internet spurred the dispensation of information. It was revolutionary; way more massive than the Gutenberg press. It changed the way we would access the information, from tangible papers to a new paradigm that the future will pursue – websites.

                            The main purpose of the website was to provide information which later one evolved for the marketing. Websites during this classic HTML era were just static pages with content and media that anyone could access by visiting the URL address. The reason these websites are called static is that the content remains the same each and every time a visitor accesses it. And any changes in the page could be made by adding the content in the HTML.

                            On the contrary modern websites use more than just HTML. Languages like CSS and JavaScript are prominently used and even there is a heaven-high and hell-deep of difference in the designs.</div>
